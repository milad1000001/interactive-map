# Leaflet Map with Next.js and Mock API

This project demonstrates the use of Leaflet with Next.js to create an interactive map application. The application fetches mock address data based on the latitude and longitude of the map's center, updates the URL with these coordinates, and keeps a marker centered on the map during dragging.
